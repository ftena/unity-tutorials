This project was made following the tutorial 'Persistence: Saving and Loading Data': https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/persistence-saving-and-loading-data

# Simple 3D Scene

Project made following the projects 'Foundations of real-time 3D' [1] and 'Foundations of programming in Unity' [2].

The objectives for those projects were:

(from [1])
- Create a new 3D project.
- Create 3D objects in the Unity Editor.
- Move, scale, and rotate objects in 3D space.
- Control the properties and behaviors of 3D objects using components.
- Create and apply a Material to a 3D object.
- Adjust the Directional Light in a 3D Scene.
- Find and import 3D assets from the Unity Asset Store.
- Publish a 3D project.

(from [2])
- Explain the role of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in Unity 
- Open the IDE from the Unity Editor 
- Create a new script component 
- Understand the purpose of the default code generated within a newly created C# script 
- Print a message to the Unity Editor console using a simple script
- Change a GameObject using a simple script 
- Explain the relationship between scripts and components 

# Introduction to Audio

Project made following the project 'Foundations of real-time audio'. Objetives:

- Define the role of an Audio Source, an Audio Clip, and an Audio Listener in a Scene
- Implement audio that appears to come from a particular point in 3D space (e.g. localized sound effects) and audio that appears to come from no place in particular (e.g. background music)
- Configure the rolloff of an Audio Source in order to control how its volume changes with distance (e.g. logarithmic, linear, or custom)
- Programmatically play, pause, and stop sounds from a script in order to control audio effects based on certain events.

# Foundations of real-time 2D

Project made following the project 'Foundations of real-time 2D'. Objetives:

- Create a new 2D project.
- Create and manipulate 2D objects in the Unity Editor.
- Control the properties and behaviors of 2D objects, including ways they interact with each other.
- Find and import 2D assets from the Unity Asset Store.
